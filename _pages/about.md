## Over 10 years of web development, 1 year of woodworking, and 15 years of beard-growing.

Hello. My name is Kristian. I love bacon, hockey, woodworking and making things on the internet. To me, web development is not a job or a career, it's a passion. Ever since I coded my first html tag I've been constantly learning and I don't believe I'll ever stop..nor do I want to.

To prove my point about constantly learning, this site is built with Jekyll, which up until now I've never used. This site is a constant work-in-progress so keep checking back...but it's pretty slick already, right?!

I hope you enjoy my work.

Looking for my CV? <a href="/assets/pdf/KristianRogelstad_cv.pdf" target="_blank" class="linkU"><strong>It's right here!</strong></a>
