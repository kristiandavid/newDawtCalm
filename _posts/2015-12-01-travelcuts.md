#### The Client
"While we may have started in the 60s, travelcuts is NOT your parents' travel booking experience. The world is constantly changing, and you need a travel website that keeps up with your needs. We are an all-online experience so you can get your vacation inspiration, do your research, and book your trip, all without leaving the house.""

#### The Story
Travelcuts was in need of a complete overhaul of their branding and website. Ariad was tasked with creating the new site for them. I was involved in the frontend development of the site, working alongside one of my colleagues at Ariad. The timeline was tight and the workload was intense but as usual, we got it done. This was also built in Umbraco, a .NET CMS system.
