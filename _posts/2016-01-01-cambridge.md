#### The Client
Since its inception in 1992, Cambridge has grown to be among the largest privately owned foreign exchange specialists globally. Cambridge has built a world-class operation renowned for innovative solutions and exemplary service. Cambridge aims to continue to thrive in an increasingly competitive market by acquiring the best expertise in the industry, leveraging strategic partnerships, and investing in leading-edge technologies.

#### The Story
Cambridge was in need of a new, modern website to attract visitors, so they came to Ariad. I was in charge of rebuilding their site from the ground up to be fully responsive and modular. Using Wordpress, instead of building page templates I built dynamic modules that could be reused across multiple pages and sections. Turned out pretty good if I do say so myself.
