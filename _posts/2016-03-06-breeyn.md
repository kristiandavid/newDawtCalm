#### The Client
Breeyn McCarney is awesome.

#### The Story
Building out breeyn.com was a very rewarding challenge. Her main request was something developers long to hear from clients, but rarely do...simplify. She wanted to remove a lot of the unnecessary adornment on her previous site but still retain the content and visual appeal of her brand.

It was no easy feat, I'll be honest. The process went through several rounds of redesign and redevelopment, each time removing bits and pieces until we were finally left with a simple, clean looking site that still got across the quality of her work.
