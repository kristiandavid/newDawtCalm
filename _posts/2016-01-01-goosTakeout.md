#### The Client
Rajeev 'Goo' Jilka has been in the kitchens of independent and chain restaurants for over five years. Goo is experienced in a wide range of restaurant related activities from serving, managing bars and kitchens and all phases of cooking. This natural progression to head chef of Goo's take-out is the logical next step in his diverse career.

Goo has many sources of inspiration for this classic base menu of Canadian favourites...with a twist. The twist comes from a passion for trying new food combinations and exposure to world foods and flavours.

#### The Story
I may be biased here, but Goo is the best chef I've ever known...he's also one of my best friends. This site was built in 2010 when he launched his awesome take-out restaurant in our hometown of Brantford, ON (the home of Wayne Gretzky by the way). I also helped Goo set up his social media accounts which get hundreds of views and messages daily.

Goo and I are currently working on a complete overhaul of his site utilizing Wordpress and If This Than That to keep his social media all in sync. Stay tuned!
