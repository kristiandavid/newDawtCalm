Hi! I'm KristianDavid. this is my repo for my new portfolio site. It's a constant work in progress so if anyone has any suggestions, feel free to let me have it.

I'm learning Jekyll to build this out and a special thanks to [core77](https://github.com/core77/jekyll-foundation) for jekyll-foundation.


Quickstart your Jekyll (v3) project with Zurb Foundation for Sites (v6, sass).

This package is meant to build your Site on your local machine.

It provides a [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) workflow with

- Browsersync (live reload and synchronised browser testing)
- Concatenation and minification of CSS and JavaScript files
- Static asset revisioning by appending content hash to filenames for production builds
- Proper browser caching
- Asset management is done by Bower (and Composer if you need serverside libraries)  
- Deployment with rsync
