Hi! I'm KristianDavid. this is my repo for [my new portfolio site](http://www.kristiandavid.com). It's a constant work in progress so if anyone has any suggestions, feel free to let me have it.

I'm learning [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build this out and am using the best responsive framework out there, [Foundation 6!](http://foundation.zurb.com). A special thanks to [core77](https://github.com/core77/jekyll-foundation) for jekyll-foundation.
